Decision Tree Regression Analysis
Project Overview
This project explores the use of decision tree regression models on a simple dataset consisting of two features. The main objective is to demonstrate the process of fitting a decision tree to the data, evaluating its performance, and interpreting the results.


Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains two columns, labeled as 1 and 100. The data appears to be synthetically generated for the purpose of demonstrating basic regression techniques.


'1': Independent variable (Feature)
'100': Dependent variable (Target)


Tools and Technologies
Language: Python 3
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Platform: Kaggle Notebooks


Model Description
The model implemented in this project is a Decision Tree Regressor. Decision trees are a type of model that makes decisions based on asking a series of questions based on the feature(s) of the dataset. This model was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability.


Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric, which quantifies the difference between the predicted and actual values.
